# Formalization of typed actors with selective receive

The source code for my Master's Thesis.  
The work takes inspiration from the lambda-calculus Î»act, 
defined in [Mixing Metaphors: Actors as Channels and Channels as Actors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06276),
and aims to provide a formalization of type safe Erlang-like actors.
In my formalization Actors are modelled as parameterized monads,
in a style inspired by Effects from Idris and Koen Claessen's Poor Man's Concurrency Monad.


| Dependency       | Version                                  |
|------------------|---------|
| Agda             | 2.5.4.2 |
| standard-library | v0.17   |

## How to build?
You can follow [Agda's installation guide](http://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html)
or build from source.
My preferred way is to to clone the repo, checkout the release-2.5.4.2 branch and run
`stack install --stack-yaml stack-8.2.2.yaml`.

The project itself can be built with make or using agda-mode in emacs.
Latex files can be generated with `make latex`, but most of the thesis is kept in ShareLatex.
