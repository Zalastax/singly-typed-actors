# Formalization of typed actors with selective receive

The source code for my Master's Thesis.  
The work takes inspiration from the lambda-calculus Î»act, defined in [Mixing Metaphors: Actors as Channels and Channels as Actors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06276), and aims to provide a formalization of type safe Erlang-like actors. In my formalization Actors are modelled as indexed monads, in a style inspired by Effects from Idris and Koen Claessen's Poor Man's Concurrency Monad.
