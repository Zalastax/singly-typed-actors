# Formalization of typed actors with selective receive

The source code for my Master's Thesis.  
The work takes inspiration from the lambda-calculus Î»act, 
defined in [Mixing Metaphors: Actors as Channels and Channels as Actors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06276),
and aims to provide a formalization of type safe Erlang-like actors.
In my formalization Actors are modelled as indexed monads,
in a style inspired by Effects from Idris and Koen Claessen's Poor Man's Concurrency Monad.


| Dependency       | Version                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Agda             | 8a7ad7f79c09d3a55110b6f92ab07267564601f0 |
| standard-library | 2a40a031e40042e72e245cce17956e5df49fcdd5 |

## How to build?
Agda and the standard library are nightlies for Agda 2.5.4.
The simplest way to build Agda is to clone the repo and run
`stack install --stack-yaml stack-8.2.2.yaml`.
The nightlies are used to get do-notation and solve some bugs with codata.

The project itself can be built with make or using agda-mode in emacs.
Latex files can be generated with `make latex`, but most of the thesis is kept in ShareLatex.
