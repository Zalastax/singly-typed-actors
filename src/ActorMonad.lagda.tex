An Actor is indexed by the shape of its inbox.

The shape dictates what types the messages sent to an actor can have,
 and thus also what types the messages being received by the actor can have.

The shape is constant over the actors whole life-time.
It would be nice to allow the shape to grow monotonically over time.

%<*InboxShape>
Our typing rules for communication are based on the idea that the most important
property of a message is that it can be understood by the receiver.
The type system will thus be used to limit what type a message sent to an inbox can have.
By limiting the types of messages sent to an inbox,
we can make sure that every message read from the inbox has a valid type.
In terms of \textcite{DBLP:conf/agere/KosterCM16}, this is the interface of the actor.

\AgdaTarget{MessageType}
\AgdaTarget{ValueType}
\AgdaTarget{ReferenceType}
\AgdaTarget{InboxShape}
\begin{code}
mutual
  data MessageField : Set₁ where
    ValueType : Set → MessageField
    ReferenceType : InboxShape → MessageField

  MessageType = List MessageField

  InboxShape = List MessageType
\end{code}

The \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape} is a variant type that details
all the messages that can be received from an inbox.
Every message sent to an actor will have exactly one of the types that is listed.
We can think of the \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape} as a set of types,
and every message coming paired with a proof that the message is a type from that set.
To know what type a message has you have to inspect the proof,
and the value or reference in the message will become accessible.
For those familiar with Haskell,
\AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape} can be seen as a generalized Either type.

\AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{MessageType} also uses a list as its underlying data structure,
but for a rather different purpose.
\AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{MessageType} is the type of a single message,
and every element in the list represents a single field in a record.
\AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{MessageType} can thus be seen as a generalized tuple type.

The fields in \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{MessageType} are either a value type or a reference type.
A value type is any type from Agda's lowest set universe.
Typical examples are \AgdaRef[Examples/Types]{Bool}, \AgdaRef[Examples/Types]{ℕ},
or \AgdaRef[Examples/Types]{⊤}.
We limit the types to the lowest set universe since it's not clear how values of
higher universes could be serialized and sent over the wire in a distributed setting,
since that would entail serializing the types themselves.
Unfortunately, the lowest set universe also contain functions that have their types fully specified:
\AgdaCatch{Examples/Types}{unfortunate}
We could of course add further constraints on the types,
e.g. that every value has to be serializable,
but due to its insignificance to the calculus we have opted not to.

A reference is directly tied to an underlying inbox and
what inbox that is can not change during its lifetime.
The type of a reference specifies what type a message sent via the reference can have,
and is used to uphold the guarantee that every message in the inbox
can be understood by the receiver.
The guarantee is automatically enforced since sending an actor a message
of the wrong type will raise a compilation error.
By using type-parameterized actor references,
the receiver does not need to worry about unexpected messages,
while senders can be sure that messages will be understood.
Typically, the reference type should be the smallest set of types
that will be sent using that reference.
%</InboxShape>

%<*InboxShapeSubtype>
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a design principle that states
that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use \parencite{martin2002agile}.
When clients depend upon objects which contain methods used only by other clients,
this can lead to fragile code \parencite{martin2002agile}.
In particular, if a client depends on an interface that contains
methods that the client does not use but others do,
that client will be affected by changes that those other clients
force on the interface \parencite{martin2002agile}.
This idea has also been addressed in the context of actor systems
where \textcite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/HeWT14} uses the term \emph{type pollution problem}
to describe the issue of actor interfaces being too fat.

Just as the advice of ISP is to break each class into granular interfaces,
the advice of \textcite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/HeWT14} is
to break the type of inboxes into granular subtypes.
What the subtype relation means is that given two inboxes $A$ and $B$,
if $A <: B$, then every message in $A$ is also a valid message in $B$.
Since we model \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape} as a set,
our subtype relation can be taken to just be the subset relation.
The drawback of using subsets is that recursive subtypes are not captured,
but we deem it good enough for our purposes and simple to work with.

\begin{code}
_<:_ = _⊆_ {A = MessageType}
\end{code}
%</InboxShapeSubtype>

%<*ActorPrecondition>
It is crucial that actor references are completely unforgeable if type safety is to be preserved.
If an actor is allowed to manufacture references on their own,
every guarantee we have about message types becomes invalid and unusable.
If either the name or the type of a reference can be controlled in user space,
then it becomes possible to create references to inboxes that are incompatible
and thus possible to send messages that will not be understood by the received.
In an informal setting we could simply have hidden the constructor of actor references,
i.e. by moving it to an internal module or marking it as abstract.
That tactic is simple and pragmatic, but does not work in a formal setting like Agda.
This posed a difficult problem in our implementation
since we realized that we would need to make a major diversion from how
references are handled by \textcite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/FowlerLW17}.

When \textcite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/FowlerLW17} type terms,
values and references are treated the same way.
Since our model is an embedding in Agda,
this would mean that both references and values are normal Agda terms.
Initially we tried to follow this route by modelling references as a name tagged with a type.
\AgdaCatch{Examples/Types}{ActorRef}
One quickly realizes that this data-type is easily forged and, as said,
hiding the constructor is not a good enough option.
We also realized that it would not be possible to maintain any proofs of references being valid
if we went this route, a problem related to how we incorporate Agda functions in the syntax.
The solution that seemed to fit best in the setting of Agda
is to treat references separately from values.
This comes from the fact that we need to maintain proofs about references being valid,
while values are only restricted under Agda's usual typing rules.

The way references are type checked is exactly how one would
type check variables in any lambda calculus,
i.e. by maintaining a variable typing context.
This is commonly done by associating unique variable names to types.
Variable names makes expressions easy to understand for humans,
but pose two annoying problems: α-renaming and α-equivalence.
α-equivalence is a form of equivalence that captures the intuition that the particular choice of
a bound variable name does not usually matter \parencite{turbak2008design}.
Renaming the variables of an expression in a way that preserves α-equivalence
is called α-renaming \parencite{turbak2008design}.
α-renaming is a part of the general concept of substitution,
the operation of replacing free occurances of a varibale with an expression.
The role of α-renaming in substituion is to avoid accidental variable name captures by renaming
variables so that substitution does not change the meaning of functions \parencite{turbak2008design}.

In order to avoid the problem of α-equivalence and α-renaming,
a common formalization technique is the use of de Bruijn indices
to represent variable binders \parencite{DBLP:journals/entcs/BerghoferU07}.
A de Bruijn index is a natural number that represents an occurance of a variable in a λ-term,
and denotes the number of binders that are in scope between that occurance
and its corresponding binder.
Following are some examples comparing a λ-calculus with names
and a λ-calculus using de Bruijn indices.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Named                           & de Bruijn           \\
$ λ x → x $                     & $ λ 1 $             \\
$ λ x → λ y → x $               & $ λ λ 2 $           \\
$ λ x → λ y → λ z → x z (y z) $ & $ λ λ λ 3 1 (2 1) $ \\         
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

What makes de Bruijn indices easy to work with in Agda is that it lets us manage
the variable typing context as a list of types, with variables / de Bruijn indices being
indices into that list.
We choose to represent the indices as the membership proposition
in order to make the de Bruijn indices correct by construction.
Thus we can define the type judgement $Γ ⊢ T$ as:

\AgdaCatch{Membership}{ElementIn}
\AgdaTarget{ReferenceTypes}
\begin{code}
ReferenceTypes = List InboxShape
TypingContext = ReferenceTypes

_⊢_ : TypingContext → InboxShape → Set₁
Γ ⊢ T = T ∈ Γ

\end{code}
%</ActorPrecondition>

%<*ReferenceSubtype>
For inboxes the subtype relation $A <: B$ says that
every message in $A$ is also a valid message in $B$.
It should therefore be possible to downcast a reference of type $B$ to a reference of type $A$,
since every message sent to a reference of type $A$ will be a valid message in $B$.
We can see that the subtype relation for references is reversed,
and is thus contravariant in its argument \parencite{DBLP:conf/ecoop/HeWT14}.
We capture this property in a special version of the reference typing judgement,
where $Γ ⊢>: T$ says that T is a subtype of some type in Γ.

\begin{code}
record _⊢>:_ (Γ : TypingContext) (requested : InboxShape) : Set₁ where
  constructor [_]>:_
  field
    {actual} : InboxShape
    actual-is-sendable : Γ ⊢ actual
    actual-handles-requested : requested <: actual

\end{code}

The notion of a subtype for references is important to implement
the pattern of sending a command together with what reference to reply to,
since different actors receiving the reply will have a different \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape}.
This pattern, together with a filtering receive construct,
can be used to implement synchronous calls \parencite{ericsson_gen}.
%</ReferenceSubtype>

%<*Messages>
A message is made of two parts: a selection of which type of message it is and instantiations
of every field of the selected type.
We index the type of a message by the type of inbox it is being sent to and incidentally by the
variable typing context.
Selecting which type variant this message has is done by indexing
into the \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{InboxShape}, using the $∈$ property.
The rest of the message is made up of instantiations of the fields
from the selected \AgdaRef[ActorMonad]{MessageType}.
For values, the instantiation of a field is simply an Agda term of the type specified by the field.

-- We can create a value message for an inbox of shape S,
-- if the type of the value is a value type for S.

-- We can create a reference message for an inbox of shape S,

--
-- When a reference message is received, the actors capabilities will increase,
-- allowing the actor to send messages to the actor referenced by the message.
--

-- A Message is either a value or a reference.

-- We could just have wrapped ValueMessage and ReferenceMessage,
